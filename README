This tiny program prints full path of the "root" git directory you're in,
or exits(1) if you're not inside some git repo.

It is intended to be run thousands of times within various scripts,
thus the C version, consuming the least amount of RSS possible.

License is FreeBSD 2-clause license, but the author was too lazy
to put it here.
